DATE,UBIT,Duration,Activity and Tool Description
2/16/2025,jeforget,1 hour,"Set up basic functionality of -f flag. Added an else that will catch undefined behavior. I also modified the activity file to format it a bit differently."
2/23/2025,jeforget,20 minutes,"Looked over csv.c, tested in gdb and chnaged line 98 of csv.c to fix an error where a char * was being passed when an int was needed."
2/24/2025,jeforget,50 minutes,"Began adding -records functionality to csv.c. Starting off without -h. Currently causes a seg fault when you try to run -records, I will look into this once I have more time."
2/25/2025,jeforget,30 minutes,"Worked through fixing -records. I was comparing the values incorrectly which was causing some bugs. Rn it just prints a bunch of values but that's better than a seg fault."
2/26/2025,jeforget,40 minutes,"Worked on fixing -records, tested with multiple csv files. -records now outputs what it's supposed to, and doesn't seg fault on the given test csv file. For some reason it seg faults on other csv files though."
2/28/2025,jeforget,3 hours,"Fixed the bug where the last field in the csv had a trailing '\r\n' on it which caused it to not print right by adding a conditional that tests for if it's the last column and then places a '\0' there isntead. Fixed a bug where float values had extra zeros however now some vlaues that should have no 0s have them so I'll come back to fix that. Also fixed a bug where -records would infinitly loop when -h was there by adding in a conditional that checks for if it's not -mean/-min/etc and stops the loop. Currently fighting with a bug where if -h is used with -r it just returns nothing." 
2/28/2025,jeforget,1 hour 30 minutes,"-r now works with -h. After fighting with it for a long time I just moved the logic for -r to the top of the call_h function. There was a bug where some things were printing correctly but still exiting with EXIT_FAILURE. I was able to fix this by going through each flag and making sure after the loops and stuff it returns the right thing instead of returning nothing. I can't seem to find a way to get the extra zeros off of numbers like 2004, but other than that I think I've fixed everything. I tested all of the inputs from the handout, as well as some extra ones and everyhting seems to be working save for the extra 0s."
