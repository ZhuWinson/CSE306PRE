DATE,UBIT,Duration,Activity and Tool Description
2/12/2025,winsonzh,10 minutes,"Set up the basic files with git and the command line"
2/13/2025,winsonzh,30 minutes,"Set up the basics of the PRE like csv.c, activity.csv, and importing the sample csv using emacs and git"
2/16/2025,jeforget,1 hour,"Set up basic functionality of -f flag. Added an else that will catch undefined behavior. I also modified the activity file to format it a bit differently."
2/16/2025,morohunf,1 hour 30 minutes, "Set up basic funtionality of -r flag. Improved programs capability to run different command-line arguments at once e.g. %csv -f -r file_name.csv."
2/19/2025,marieleo,1 hour 40 minutes, "Set up helper function for -h flag. Main includes checking for -h and then calling it."
2/20/2025,morohunf,10 minutes, "Added a new condition that catches irregular/incorrect use of -h flag in command line operation."
2/20/2025,winsonzh,1 hour, "Started on -min and then set up code to get information to complete the flag such as finding out # of rows and columns in csv. Also starting to copy content from csv into 2D array with emacs. Tested with gdb"
2/20/2025,winsonzh,2 hours, "Copied csv contents into a 2D array to use for flags such as -min and -max and wrote the basics for both with emacs. Tested with gdb"
2/23/2025,jeforget,20 minutes,"Looked over csv.c, tested in gdb and chnaged line 98 of csv.c to fix an error where a char * was being passed when an int was needed."
2/24/2025,jeforget,50 minutes,"Began adding -records functionality to csv.c. Starting off without -h. Currently causes a seg fault when you try to run -records, I will look into this once I have more time."
2/24/2025,winsonzh,1 hour, "Fixed copying code and finished -min and -max without headers using emacs and gdb"
2/24/2025,winsonzh,1 hour 30 minutes, "Added in dealing with commas in fields and started on -mean flag (no header) with emacs and gdb"
2/24/2025,morohunf,1 hour, "Created seperate helper functions for -min, -max and -mean flag and edited the csv code to allow it to run all the flags called on the command line before returning."
2/25/2025,jeforget,30 minutes,"Worked through fixing -records. I was comparing the values incorrectly which was causing some bugs. Rn it just prints a bunch of values but that's better than a seg fault."
2/26/2025,jeforget,40 minutes,"Worked on fixing -records, tested with multiple csv files. -records now outputs what it's supposed to, and doesn't seg fault on the given test csv file. For some reason it seg faults on other csv files though."
2/26/2025,winsonzh,1 hour,"Fixed seg fault and fixed -mean flag (no headers) using emacs and gdb"
2/26/2025,morohunf,30 mins,"Created a list of strings for the fieldNames which we could use with writing the code for -h flag. Tried making sure the list was correct with gdb but for some reason was unable to so resulted with using print statement."
2/26/2025,morohunf,3 hours 30 minutes, "Finished the helper function for -h flag (call_h) and help up function calls for all other flags in call_h. Also set up a helper function for the -records. Used gdb to debug the code and find any stray faults/bugs"
2/26/2025,marieleo,3 hours 30 minutes, "Finished the helper function for -h flag (call_h) and help up function calls for all other flags in call_h. Also set up a helper function for the -records. Used gdb to debug the code and find any stray faults/bugs"
2/28/2025,morohunf,10 minutes, "Created an activity csv file for each group member and copied their activity log from the activity.csv file."
2/28/2025,jeforget,3 hours,"Fixed the bug where the last field in the csv had a trailing '\r\n' on it which caused it to not print right by adding a conditional that tests for if it's the last column and then places a '\0' there isntead. Fixed a bug where float values had extra zeros however now some vlaues that should have no 0s have them so I'll come back to fix that. Also fixed a bug where -records would infinitly loop when -h was there by adding in a conditional that checks for if it's not -mean/-min/etc and stops the loop. Currently fighting with a bug where if -h is used with -r it just returns nothing." 
2/28/2025,jeforget,1 hour 30 minutes,"-r now works with -h. After fighting with it for a long time I just moved the logic for -r to the top of the call_h function. There was a bug where some things were printing correctly but still exiting with EXIT_FAILURE. I was able to fix this by going through each flag and making sure after the loops and stuff it returns the right thing instead of returning nothing. I can't seem to find a way to get the extra zeros off of numbers like 2004, but other than that I think I've fixed everything. I tested all of the inputs from the handout, as well as some extra ones and everyhting seems to be working save for the extra 0s."
